# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Does the output have to match identically for Q2?

No, Wikipedia is being constantly updated and it looks like wget pulls just slightly different information at times depending on what type of computer you connect from, where you're located etc. Make sure that the specification is matched: that is everything you output follows the pattern I requested. I do think this means you'll be within 1-2 lines of the provided sample, but just dont worry about tiny differences. 

- Does the PageName after a href have to equal the PageName after title?

This was a mistake I made. I thought they were always equal on Wiki pages and so didn't fully specify. You can either restrict to only printing links where those names are equal, or print either the first or the second string in case they differ, so long as you only find things that do indeed have both a href and title components as the pattern shows.

- What's the largest diamond we'll test?

Make sure you get get to 127 at minimum to ensure full marks. For many solutions, there will not be any real limit, since the code runs fast and takes little memory. It's a nice challenge to see how large you can make it.
