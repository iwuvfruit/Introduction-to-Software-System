Q1)
    a)
104kg
364kg
450kg
1000kg
1800kg
4900kg
29000kg
110000kg

I discovered this by running
grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,}kg' *.dat | sort -t: -n -k2 | cut -d":" -f2
#I'm using grep and regular expression to grab all {numbers+kg} in the files that end with dat. And doing a numeric sort with sort method. I added cut at the end because the question says "ignore name here". 


    b)
24m
15m
6m
5m
5m
4m
1m
0m

I discovered this by running
grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,}m' *.dat | sort -r -t: -n -k2 | cut -d":" -f2
#I'm using grep and regular expression to grab all {number+m} in the files that end with dat. And doing a numeric sort in reverse with sort -r method. I added cut at the end because the question says "ignore name here". 
    c)
Elephants weight more

I discovered this by creating a bash file and running that bash file. Following is the code in my bash file.
#!/bin/bash

#grab the weight of hippo
input=$(find *.dat -name '*hippo*')
hippoWeight=$(grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,}kg' $input)
#grab the weight of elephant
elephantWeight=$(grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,}kg' elephant.dat)
#print the weight of hippo
echo "hippo weights $hippoWeight"
#prints the weight of elephant
echo "elephant weights $elephantWeight"
#use if to find out which is heavier
if [ "${hippoWeight%kg}" -gt "${elephantWeight%kg}" ]; then
    echo "hippo weights more"
elif [ "${hippoWeight%kg}" -lt "${elephantWeight%kg}" ]; then
    echo "elephant weights more"
else
    echo "they are the same weight"
fi

    d)
The new weights is 452

I discovered this and overwrote the value 452 in the file by running
#!/bin/bash

#grabing the weight of crocodile and removing kg
crocWeight=$(grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,}kg' crocodile.dat | sed 's/[^0-9]*//g')
#adding 2 to the new weight
newWeight=$((2+$crocWeight))
#display the new weight
echo $newWeight
#need crocLength to overwrite crocodile.dat with a new crocWeight
crocLength=$(cut -d ' ' -f2 crocodile.dat)
echo $crocLength
#overwrite crocodile.dat
echo "${newWeight}kg $crocLength" > crocodile.dat
#check if it has been overwritten
cat crocodile.dat

    e)
#I remove all traces of giraffe by running the following code
rm -r *giraffe*

#I added -r just in case there's a folder named containing the word girafee
